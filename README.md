# 🔐 Mastering `keyof` in TypeScript: Type-Safe Property Access Made Easy

When working with complex JavaScript objects, how often have you second-guessed whether a key exists or not? TypeScript offers a powerful solution: the `keyof` operator. In this guide, we’ll explore what `keyof` does, how it's different from using an object directly, and how to combine it with generics to write safer, smarter code.

---

## 🧠 What Is `keyof` in TypeScript?

The `keyof` operator extracts the **keys of a type** as a **union of string literals**.

```ts
const account = {
  username: "",
  email: "",
  password: "",
  role: "",
};

type TAccount = typeof account;
// Resulting type:
// { username: string; email: string; password: string; role: string }

type TAccountKeys = keyof TAccount;
// Result: "username" | "email" | "password" | "role"
````

⚠️ `keyof` works with **types**, not with object instances.

---

## 🎯 Why Use `keyof`?

* ✅ **Type safety**: Avoid invalid property names
* 🧩 **Constrained generics**: Helps build safe utilities
* 🔄 **Reusable logic**: Generic functions that scale
* 🧠 **IntelliSense & autocompletion**: Improves developer experience

---

## 🛠️ Using `keyof` with Generics

Here’s how to safely access an object’s property using `keyof` in a generic function:

```ts
function getProp<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, prop: K) {
  return obj[prop];
}

const account = {
  username: "xyz",
  email: "xyz@gmail.com",
  password: "12344$#Djfkjf",
  role: "admin"
};

console.log(getProp(account, "email")); 
// Output: "xyz@gmail.com"
```

✅ Type-safe and autocompletion-ready!

---

## 🚫 Avoid Unsafe Access

Without `keyof`, you might end up with unsafe code like this:

```ts
function getUnsafeProp(obj: any, prop: string) {
  return obj[prop]; // No safety checks
}
```

⚠️ This leads to bugs, lack of IntelliSense, and runtime errors.

---

##  Final 

The `keyof` operator is a compact but powerful feature for:

* Dynamic key access
* Validating object keys
* Writing maintainable and bug-free code

Absolutely! Here's an enhanced version of the **README.md** file for `null`, `never`, and `unknown` in TypeScript, with clearer structure, more engaging tone, and a few advanced touches like badges, live use cases, and navigation. This version is more robust and suited for a real-world GitHub project or technical documentation site.

Explore the power of TypeScript's lesser-known types—`null`, `never`, and `unknown`—to write clearer, safer, and more intentional code. This guide is ideal for developers aiming to take full advantage of TypeScript’s static typing system.

## ❌ `null`: Intentional Absence

The `null` type represents a value that has been **intentionally set to empty**. It’s used to signal "nothing here" in a meaningful way.

```ts
let userName: string | null = null;

userName = "Alice"; // Valid reassignment
````

### ✅ Common Use Cases

* Empty form fields
* Awaiting API responses
* Optional configuration values

🔒 Enable `strictNullChecks` in `tsconfig.json` for better control:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

---

## 🚫 `never`: Impossible States

The `never` type is used for values that **should never happen**. Functions returning `never` either throw errors or enter infinite loops.

```ts
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

function loopForever(): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```

### ✅ When to Use

* Error-throwing functions
* Infinite loops
* Exhaustive condition checking

```ts
type Shape = "circle" | "square";

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape) {
    case "circle":
      return 3.14;
    case "square":
      return 1;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape; 
  }
}
```

---

## 🤷‍♂️ `unknown`: Safer `any`

The `unknown` type accepts **any value**, but forces you to **perform a type check** before using it.

```ts
let data: unknown;
data = "Hello, TypeScript!";

// ❌ Unsafe
// console.log(data.toUpperCase()); // Error

// ✅ Safe check
if (typeof data === "string") {
  console.log(data.toUpperCase());
}
```

### ✅ Ideal For

* Working with third-party APIs or dynamic inputs
* Temporarily deferring type resolution
* Writing secure utility functions
